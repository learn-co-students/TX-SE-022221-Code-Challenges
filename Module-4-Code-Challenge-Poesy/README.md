# Module 4 Code Challenge: Poesy

## Demo

Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

![Demo GIF](./demo.gif)

## Instructions

Welcome to Poesy, where your poetry masterpieces come to life! Our old front-end team laid down the foundations for our app, but it looks like they forgot all the functionality!

Your job will be to make our app work according to the user stories you will find the [Core Deliverables](#Core-Deliverables) section.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Run `npm start`. This will open both your React page on port 6002 and your backend on port 6001.

## Endpoints

The base URL for your backend is: http://localhost:6001

These are the routes you will need:

- GET `/poems`
- POST `/poems`
- DELETE `/poems/:id`

## Core Deliverables

As a user:

<!-- 1. When the app starts, I can see all currently created poems. -->
<!-- 2. I can show/hide the form to create new poems. -->
<!-- 3. I can create poems and they are still there when I refresh the page. -->
<!-- 4. I can mark poems as read which will change the text of that button to "Mark as unread". -->

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user:

1. I can add a poem to my favourites and see it on a separate list.
2. I can delete a poem and they are still gone when I refresh the page.

## Rubric
